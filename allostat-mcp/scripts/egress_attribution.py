"""Attribute egress attempts to individual tests. Diagnostic, never a boundary.

`contained_test_run.sh` reports how many routeless sends a whole session made.
That is the right shape for a gate -- one number, impossible to argue with -- and
the wrong shape for fixing anything, because "96" does not tell you which tests
to look at.

This plugin reads the same kernel counters (`Ip.OutNoRoutes` in /proc/net/snmp,
`Ip6OutNoRoutes` in /proc/net/snmp6) around each test and reports every test that
moved them. It is loaded explicitly with `-p` for diagnostic runs and is not part
of the suite's normal configuration, because a measurement that runs by default
eventually gets mistaken for a control.

WHY THE COUNTER SEES THINGS THE IN-PROCESS GUARD DOES NOT. The guard patches
`socket.socket.connect`/`connect_ex`. A packet only reaches the routing layer if
nothing intercepted the call, so anything counted here BYPASSED the guard:

  * name resolution -- `getaddrinfo` is not `connect`, so DNS was never guarded
    at all;
  * anything imported and executed at COLLECTION time, before the session
    fixture installs the patch;
  * children launched with -S/-E/-I, which never import sitecustomize;
  * non-Python children, which have no Python guard to install.

Usage:
    pytest -p scripts.egress_attribution ...
    (inside contained_test_run.sh, where the namespace makes the sends routeless)

Outside a namespace with no default route the counters do not move, and the
plugin says so rather than reporting a clean run.
