# dev_mode.ps1 - point the wrapper at the local MCP server for active dev.
#
# Usage:
#   .\scripts\dev_mode.ps1                                 # local default http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
#   .\scripts\dev_mode.ps1 -Url http://127.0.0.1:9000/mcp  # custom URL (e.g., different port)
#   .\scripts\dev_mode.ps1 -Url https://mcp-staging.allostat.ai/mcp  # point at staging
#
# Sets ALLOSTAT_MCP_URL in the current PowerShell session. Claude Code
# launched from this shell will use it. Restart Claude Code to pick up
# the change.
#
# Optional: also sets ALLOSTAT_MCP_TOKEN if -Bearer provided. Otherwise
# the wrapper falls back to its bundled .env bearer (which is the prod
# bearer for a normal install — likely 401 against local). Pass -Bearer
# when pointing at local/staging since their bearer namespaces differ
# from prod.
#
# To turn off: run .\scripts\dev_mode_off.ps1 or close the shell.
