"""Read the kernel's routeless-send counters, or refuse. (R5, 2026-07-20)

## Why this is a file and not a heredoc

It was a heredoc inside `contained_test_run.sh`, and being un-runnable on its own
meant being un-testable on its own. The only way to exercise its failure paths
was to break `/proc` underneath a live run, which nobody was going to do, so its
failure paths were never exercised — and they were wrong.

## What was wrong

The previous implementation returned `0` when `/proc/net/snmp` could not be
opened, and `0` again when the expected field was absent. Both of those mean *I
could not read the counter*, and both were reported as the number zero, which
every caller reads as *nothing attempted egress*.

The check that proves nothing escaped answered CLEAN when it was blind. That is
the same fail-open shape as the four defects the sprint was convened to close,
sitting inside the instrument doing the measuring.

## The contract

Print a single integer — the sum of IPv4 and IPv6 routeless sends in the current
network namespace — or exit 97 having explained why not. There is no third
outcome, and in particular there is no path that produces a number this module
did not actually read.

Exit 97 is the runner's "containment could not be established" code, chosen
deliberately: a measurement that did not happen is not a clean measurement, and
it should stop the run for the same reason a namespace that will not come up
stops the run.
