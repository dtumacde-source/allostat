"""Stop hook — v0.2.0 thin shim + session_id debounce.

v0.2.0 architectural changes:
  - SESSION_ID DEBOUNCE: tracks last Stop session_id in
    `<state_dir>/state/last_stop_session.json`. Claude Code emits Stop
    on every model-reply boundary, not only at session-end — so v0.1.12's
    Stop hook fired ~30:1 vs real session count. v0.2.0 fires the heavy
    dusk sweep (server dispatch + proposal extraction) only once per
    distinct session_id.
  - REPLACED the client-side classifier+loop with ONE call to
    `dispatch_stop` (server-side aggregation of volume-control +
    pattern-observer).
  - APPLIES returned `client_state_writes` (e.g., pending_proposals.jsonl).

v0.2.6 PATCH-128 A4 (Stop protocol mismatch fix):
  Claude Code's Stop event silently drops `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`
  per its hook docs. Pre-PATCH-128 emit-context calls at Stop were going
  to a black hole. Replaced with persistence-only flow: dispatch_stop
  emits pending_dusk_surface.jsonl client_state_writes; next SessionStart
  reads them and renders the carryover at dawn (where additionalContext
  IS delivered to the agent). Operator gets one consolidated dawn review
  window per dawn/dusk cycle.

    # H1 (S1 closure 2026-05-26): handoff_consolidation removed entirely.
    # Audit finding confirmed architecturally correct — the consolidation
    # sweep conflicted with the rolling-handoff protocol (A3) where Claude
    # overwrites a single per-session file in place. With overwriting,
    # there's no chain to consolidate; the helper was solving a problem
    # that A3 already prevents. handoff_consolidation.py + its tests
    # deleted from the repo; this block (which previously invoked the
    # sweep at Stop) removed.

    # A4 (2026-05-24) — auto_memory_sweep clearance removed. Pre-A4 the
    # UserPromptSubmit hook set a session_ending flag on signal-phrase
    # detection ("close session" etc.) and the Stop hook cleared it after
    # the handoff was generated. A4 sunset the signal-phrase sweep
    # directive emit + the forced handoff write; nothing sets the flag
    # anymore, so nothing needs to clear it. Ambient rolling handoffs (A3)
    # replace the eventful firing.
