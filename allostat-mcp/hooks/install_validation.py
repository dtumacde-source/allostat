"""Install-validation checks shared between session-start.py and install.ps1.

PATCH-103 — 4-state taxonomy + 4-layer checks. Extends PATCH-102's 3-state
to distinguish "plugin not loaded" (the screenshot's silent-failure mode
where hooks never fire) from "MCP not registered" from "MCP registered
but failing to connect" from "server unreachable."

The silent-failure modes this module exists to prevent:

  1. Plugin entirely inert — marketplace.json malformed → Claude Code drops
     the plugin → no banner, no hooks, no skills, no commands. PATCH-102
     couldn't detect this (because its own banner can't fire to surface
     the state). Only the installer's Step 12b probe catches it.
  2. MCP not registered — plugin loaded but `claude mcp add` never ran.
     `mcp__allostat-mcp__*` tools missing from registry.
  3. MCP failed to connect — registration present but bearer rotated or
     transport broken. `mcp__allostat-mcp__*` calls return errors.
  4. Server unreachable — network/DNS/server-down.

Five state values, ordered by precedence (advisor 2026-05-16 review §2.1):

  Layer 1: plugin loaded?         → degraded_plugin_not_loaded if no
  Layer 2: MCP server registered? → degraded_mcp_not_registered if no
  Layer 3: server reachable?      → unreachable_server if no
  Layer 4: MCP connected (✓)?     → degraded_mcp_failed_connect if no
  MCP status determinate "connected"? → healthy if yes
  (otherwise — MCP check couldn't run) → unknown (audit #11: never
                                          report healthy on unverified state)

The precedence reads: "is the plugin loaded, is registration valid, is
the network up, is auth valid." Each step assumes the prior is true.
Symptom interpretations make sense at every level — never blame "MCP
failed to connect" when the server is actually unreachable upstream.

Layer 5 (authenticated tools/list probe) lives in install.ps1 / the
shared PowerShell helper, not here — it requires the bearer which the
PowerShell installer has in hand but the Python module does not. The
session-start banner doesn't need Layer 5 because the banner runs inside
a session where MCP tools are either callable or not (and the user finds
out the moment they're invoked).

CLI exit codes for the PowerShell installer to branch on:
  0 = healthy
  1 = degraded_plugin_not_loaded
  2 = degraded_mcp_not_registered
  3 = degraded_mcp_failed_connect
  4 = unreachable_server
  5 = unknown (CLI missing, subprocess error, etc.)

    Advisor 2026-07-06 validation-honesty fix. When an update has landed on disk
    but this session is still running the previous version (the SessionStart
    caller detects this via version_skew and passes update_pending=True), a
    `degraded_mcp_failed_connect` is BENIGN: the stale process still owns the old
    MCP connection and a FULL restart clears it. Downgrade it to `pending_restart`
    (a WARN, exit 0) carrying a loud "fully restart" hint.

    NON-STICKY by construction — no marker needed. version_skew only reports skew
    on a *continuation* of a stale process; a full restart yields a fresh process
    with update_pending=False. So on the very next session after the prescribed
    restart, a STILL-failing Layer 4 is passed update_pending=False and stays
    `degraded_mcp_failed_connect` (real). "Pending restart, first observation" and
    "still red after the restart you were told to do" are thereby distinguished by
    the skew signal itself, not by this function.

    Only ever downgrades degraded_mcp_failed_connect; every other state (healthy,
    plugin-not-loaded, not-registered, unreachable) passes through untouched — an
    update-pending session with a genuinely unreachable server is still unreachable.
    Pure + ordering-independent: the caller applies it after it has the skew signal.

    failures surface the moment a tool is invoked mid-session (see the module
