"""PostToolUse hook — v0.2.0 thin shim.

v0.2.0 architectural change vs v0.1.12:
  - REMOVED the dispatch gate at line 59 (`if not is_error: return 0`).
    Every tool call now reaches the server-side dispatcher.
  - ENRICHED the local observation with file_path / command / exit_code
    so the server's classifier has actionable detail (not just tool_name).
  - REPLACED the client-side classifier+loop with ONE call to the
    server's `dispatch_post_tool_use` tool, which classifies + invokes
    pillars + aggregates server-side.
  - APPLIED any returned `client_state_writes` via lib/client_state_writer.

This is the load-bearing thin-shim conversion: the wrapper hook is now a
~80-line forwarder. Decision logic lives server-side.
