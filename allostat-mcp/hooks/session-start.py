"""SessionStart hook — wrapper plugin entrypoint at session begin.

Emits the operator-facing Allostat banner block. PATCH-103 extends to
five states so silent install failures (including the plugin-inert mode
the screenshot session showed) stop being indistinguishable from healthy:

    ✅ Allostat active.                                       ← healthy
    ⚠ Allostat degraded — plugin not loaded.                  ← Layer 1 fail*
       Fix: <hint>
    ⚠ Allostat degraded — MCP not registered.                ← Layer 2 fail
       Fix: <hint>
    ⚠ Allostat degraded — MCP failing to connect.            ← Layer 4 fail
       Fix: <hint>
    ❌ Allostat unreachable — server not responding.         ← Layer 3 fail

* Layer 1 (plugin not loaded) is paradoxical from the banner's POV:
  if the plugin isn't loaded, the SessionStart hook never fires and the
  banner never renders. The state is only reachable here in the
  fail-soft scenario where claude CLI returns plugin-disabled but the
  hook is somehow still firing. The installer's Step 12b probe is the
  primary catcher of this state.

Additionally appends:
- 📋 Recent handoff — when discover_handoffs finds one <48h old
- An orchestration directive instructing Claude to invoke the
  hypothalamic-axis skill (restores v2.3 inline-visibility surface)

(The rotating session-start tip was RETIRED with the banner — operator
2026-06-13, see the _build_banner docstring — and is no longer emitted.)

Force-display contract (PATCH-102): the banner ALWAYS renders, even when
the cwd-resolution falls back or the .allostat state dir is missing. The
only opt-out is ALLOSTAT_DISABLED=1 (bench-harness flag). Operator
sessions can no longer end up in a silent state.

Server-side: dispatches hypothalamic_axis_route session_start_state when
the token is available (logged silently, never surfaced as an error).

        harness directory standing in for an unknown project. Whatever
        handoffs live there belong to a PARALLEL tree; auto-loading one as
        the authoritative resume core is how a 2026-06-27 summary got
        presented as current state. Degraded mode: a warning line that says
        exactly that, NO body injection, one durable
        `continuity_resolution_degraded` observation.
      * Divergence sentinel — the selected newest handoff must live in the
        canonical tree this session WRITES to. If it does not, and the
        canonical tree's newest is older, reads and writes are split across
        two trees: warn with both paths, record
        `continuity_resolution_divergent`, and still inject the newest body
        (it is the best continuity available — the LINE is what must not
        reassure).

    Per-project latest (never a global handoff); excludes the `.detail.md`
    sibling. Best-effort — any failure returns (None, None) so continuity logic
    never breaks session start.

    `profile` controls the injected body's char budget (Codex adapter);
    defaults to `get_profile()` (reads --harness from argv) so existing
    callers/tests stay backward-compatible with the Claude 8000-char cap.

# the hook's additionalContext verbatim as the last visible content.

# That CLAUDE.md block is operator-machine-only. Customers have no such
# block, so the banner content was rendered loosely or summarized.
#
# E9 closes the gap: the hook itself emits an explicit render instruction
# alongside the banner content. Customer install gets banner rendering
# without needing any CLAUDE.md block.
#
# Backward-compatible: works whether or not operator's CLAUDE.md still has
# the block. Operator can strip the block post-E9 (separate operator+advisor
# session per the E9 brief §2 "Post-ship operator+advisor work").
#
# E9-A path: drops the memory-arch self-check (`✅ Memory architecture intact.`)

# Claude inspecting its own context, and the value-vs-complexity tradeoff

    #
    # Closes the protocol-spec gap where Claude had to infer cwd-sanitization
    # to compute the handoff write path. Diagnostic 2026-05-26 P1 found Claude
    # writing to divergent cwd-sanitization trees (and to legacy timestamp
    # filenames pattern-matched off operator chat references) because the
    # protocol said `<cwd>` without specifying which sanitization. Result:
    # watchdog looked at one path, Claude wrote to another, reminders fired
    # forever.
    #
    # Fix: wrapper computes the canonical path here (via the same
    # `session_handoff.sanitize_cwd_for_harness` the watchdog uses) and
    # surfaces it to Claude via additionalContext as `handoff_path`. Claude's
    # protocol then prescribes "write to the provided handoff_path"; no
    # inference required, no divergence possible.

    # canon_size_discipline.md, plus A3's claude_handoff_protocol.md).
    # Phase 3.1 Bucket A dedup (v1.4.21) moved these to topic-conditional

    # as a regression — architecture context silently absent from most
    # sessions because predictions miss. Always-on is the restored design.

    # project (per PROJECT_REGISTRY in conditional_loader). Non-Allostat
    # cwds (scratch folders, experimental work) don't pay the ~17KB token
    # cost where there's zero recall value.
    #
    # Files are read from operator-side appendix folder (already seeded
    # above by `seed_default_appendices`). Edits operator made to those
    # files are preserved per `feedback_migration_never_destroys_existing_files.md`.

    # profile's granular `always_on_exclude` filter (see HarnessProfile.
