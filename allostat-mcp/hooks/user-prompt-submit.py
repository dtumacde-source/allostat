"""UserPromptSubmit hook — v0.2.0 thin shim.

v0.2.0 architectural change vs v0.1.12:
  - CAPTURE prompt text (up to 500 chars) into the local observation
    log so the server's classifier + drift detection have actionable
    context. Operator consented per round4 brief §3.1 + §0:
    "no privacy concerns, RAM only, deleted." Server NEVER persists
    the prompt — only uses it to compute a decision then releases.
  - REPLACED the client-side classifier+loop with ONE call to
    `dispatch_user_prompt_submit` (server-side classification + pillar
    invocation + aggregation).
  - APPLIES returned `client_state_writes` via client_state_writer.

Session-end signal detection (α.5 acceptance) stays client-side as a
fast local check that doesn't require the server.
