"""Workflow phase-gate logic — rule innate-11 (workflow gate nudge).

Rule 11 treats decision gates declared in `workflow_*.md` files as
innate-tier hard pauses: work may not cross a phase boundary without
explicit operator approval of that phase's gate. Origin: an autonomous
predeployment session scaffolded many Phase deliverables of a workflow
without firing any of the workflow's own declared gates — the gates were
WRITTEN but never ENFORCED, forcing the operator to backfill review of
dozens of unchecked decision items.

Contract (rules/innate/11-workflow-gate-nudge.yaml):
  - detection_logic: hypothalamic-axis calls
    `surface_workflow_gates(operator_message, project_memory)`. When a
    workflow is in play and work tries to advance to a phase whose
    entry-gate hasn't been approved, the rule fires.
  - parser_strategy:
      * structured_table — `## Decision gates` / `## Decision gates index`
        sections (one gate per list row: `- Phase N: <criteria>`)
      * inline_mention  — `Decision gate at end of Phase N: <criteria>` prose
  - phase tracking (v1 coarse heuristics):
      * "phase N complete" / "phase N ready" / "moving to phase N" mark a
        boundary; the LEFT phase's gate must be approved first.
      * "approve <phase> gate" approves a gate.
      * exception phrase: "skip <phase> gate — <reason>".
  - surface_helpers: `format_gates_overview`, `format_gate_pause`.

Rule 11 is designated guidance-only, so its producer may not be wired into
the PreToolUse path — but this module is importable and fully tested to the
contract so the producer can be wired without further code archaeology.

Pure text logic — no filesystem, no network. Never raises on bad input.
