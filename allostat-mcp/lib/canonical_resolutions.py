"""Wrapper-local canonical-text store for silo entries.

Phase 2 (2026-05-28) silo-leak fix. Pairs with `lib/silo_base.py`:
- Silo entries on disk (`<state_dir>/silos/<class>.jsonl`) carry the
  fingerprint hash + provenance + timestamps. They never carry the
  operator's canonical text.
- Canonical text lives ONLY here, in `<state_dir>/silos/canonical_resolutions.jsonl`.
  One file global across all silo classes. Wrapper-local, never crosses
  the wire to the server.

Why the split:
  Pre-Phase-2, every silo entry stored the operator's full correction prompt
  in `resolution.canonical_value`. Those entries got shipped back to the
  server as `excerpt.retrievals` on every subsequent dispatch — operator's
  corrected truth crossed the wire repeatedly even after first inscribe.
  Phase 2 makes silo entries wire-shape by construction; canonical text
  is wrapper-local from the moment of write.

Operator-facing recall UI joins `<class>.jsonl` entries with this file by
fingerprint_hash to display human-readable canonical text. Server never
reads this file.

Schema (Phase 2 refined 2026-05-28 post-audit):
  {
    "fingerprint_hash": str,    # sha256 truncated-16, mirrors silo_base
    "payload": dict,            # arbitrary canonical fields; PER-SILO-CLASS
    "raw_excerpt": str,         # human-readable surface (was fingerprint.raw_excerpt)
    "silo_class": str,          # drift / voice / customization / workflow / confidence_recovery
    "session_id": str,
    "created_at": str,          # ISO-8601 UTC
  }

Payload shape varies by silo class — anything the silo composer put in
`resolution` that isn't `canonical_source` (a known-safe reference string)
gets relocated here. Examples:
  drift:       {"canonical_value": "<full operator prompt>"}
  voice:       {"canonical_sample": "...", "canonical_source": "..."}
  workflow:    {"canonical_fix": "...", "lesson": "..."}
  customization: {"chosen_option": "...", "rationale": "..."}
  confidence_recovery: {"recovery_action": "...", "ending_confidence": "..."}

Backward-compat: `inscribe(canonical_value="...")` is a thin shim that
wraps `inscribe_payload(payload={"canonical_value": "..."})`. The original
`canonical_value` key is also exposed at top level for legacy readers
(`lookup_canonical_value` returns it).

JSONL append-only. Multiple entries for the same fingerprint_hash are
allowed (e.g., refinements over time). `lookup_by_hash` returns the most
recent.
