"""Allostat — generic silo storage for allostatic memory cells.

Ported from the v2.3 plugin's lib/silo_base.py into the v2.4 wrapper.
This is the foundation module for PATCH-167 silo_inscribe port; per-class
silos (drift, voice, customization, workflow, confidence_recovery) build
on top of it.

Architecture context (v2.40 hosted-MCP):
  - Server-side recall_silos pillar already handles query_silo +
    compute_fingerprint_hash + compute_class_tokens question_types.
  - Wrapper-side INSCRIBE PATH (this module + per-class modules) was the
    v2.3→v2.40 port gap surfaced by audit 2026-05-22.
  - Silo files live at `<state_dir>/silos/<class>.jsonl` — operator-local
    per privacy moat. Wrapper reads them, passes entries as
    excerpt.retrievals to server's query_silo invocations.

Generalizes the immune_memory pattern across signal classes. Each signal
class (drift, voice, customization, confidence_recovery, workflow) gets
its own JSONL silo at `.allostat/silos/<class>.jsonl`.

Real-biology analog: each lymphocyte lineage (B-cell, T-cell, memory cell)
specializes for a class of antigen. Same shape — each silo stores resolved
cases for one signal class. Two consumers: the pillar that owns the class
(writes resolutions, queries for predictive pre-shift) and Claude (reads as
skill on relevant context).

Lifecycle:
- write_entry — append a resolved case
- read_entries — iterate all entries (skips corrupt lines)
- query_silo — fingerprint-hash match, ranked by fire_count + recency, skips decayed
- decay_quiescent — flag entries quiescent N days as decayed (default 90)
- archive_long_quiescent — move long-quiescent decayed entries to archive (default 180)

Schema versioning: SCHEMA_VERSION = 1 (no migrations needed yet). If
SiloEntry shape changes, bump SCHEMA_VERSION and add a migration in
from_jsonl.

# ============================================================================
# Phase 2 wire-shape whitelist (2026-05-28, post-audit refinement)
# ============================================================================
#
# Silo entries on the wire (wrapper -> server retrievals) carry these fields
# only. Anything outside this whitelist is operator canonical text and must
# never cross the wire — it lives wrapper-local in
# `<state_dir>/silos/canonical_resolutions.jsonl`.
#
# ultraswarm H-7/H-8 (2026-07-07): `key_tokens` was wire-whitelisted, but the
# tokens are NOT hashes — they carry raw operator/assistant content (the first
# ~80 chars of a correction claim, a 60-char assistant snippet from
# voice_keeper, raw filenames). That defeats invariant #1 ("only fingerprint
# hashes + provenance cross the wire"). Fix: the wire fingerprint now carries a
# `token_hash` (sha256 of class + sorted(tokens), the same identity hash the
# server matched on anyway) INSTEAD of the raw tokens. key_tokens stay
# wrapper-local on disk (needed for local query_silo matching) — no migration.
#
# The whitelist is intentional: future silo classes inherit the privacy
# invariant by construction. Only `canonical_source` (a known-safe reference
# string like `"operator_correction:s-id"`) stays in the wire-bound resolution.

RESOLUTION_WIRE_KEYS = frozenset({"canonical_source"})
# On disk (defense-in-depth strip) the fingerprint keeps class_name + key_tokens
# — key_tokens are the LOCAL identity surface (silo_base.query_silo, canonical
# binding, migration all read them). On the WIRE (retrievals -> server) the raw
# key_tokens are replaced by token_hash (see hash_tokens=True below) so operator
# content never crosses — ultraswarm H-7/H-8.
