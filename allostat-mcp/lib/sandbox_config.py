"""Allostat sandbox configuration loader — PATCH-142 v1.2.0.

Loads per-user sandbox-permission patterns from `~/.allostat/sandbox_config.json`
so that operator-specific path patterns NEVER ship in the plugin source code.

Before PATCH-142, `lib/sandbox_perms.py` hardcoded operator-specific
strings (a username, a drive letter, a dev directory path, a cwd slug,
and nine side-project sandbox folder names). That shipped to every
paying customer's installed plugin, making the sandbox-perms refusal
pillar a no-op on any non-operator machine (none of the substrings
matched customer paths) AND leaking the operator's side-project list
to anyone who could `grep` their own `~/.claude/plugins/`.

Audit ref: v1.1.1 audit T1 + T2 findings (kept locally on the dev's
machine; not shipped with this module).

Contract
--------
Customer side (the default):
  - No `~/.allostat/sandbox_config.json` → all pattern lists empty.
  - `sandbox_perms.is_sandbox_scoped()` returns False for all paths.
  - The pillar is a no-op (matches v1.1.1 customer behavior, just
    explicitly; the previous behavior was a no-op by accident, not
    by design).

Per-user opt-in (operator + advanced users):
  - Author `~/.allostat/sandbox_config.json` with the three pattern lists.
  - Loader reads on every hook fire (cheap; ~1ms; no caching needed
    since the file is sub-1KB and changes rarely).
  - Pillar refuses non-advisor writes to sandbox-scoped paths per the
    same logic as before — but the patterns now reflect THIS user's
    actual project layout, not operator's hardcoded names.

Schema (`~/.allostat/sandbox_config.json`):
  {
    "sandbox_scoped_substrings": [
      "/.claude/projects/<user-specific-advisor-memory>/",
      "/.claude/allostat/projects/<user-specific-project>_sandbox/",

    "dev_cwd_patterns": ["<user-specific cwd substring>"],
    "advisor_readme_path": "~/.claude/projects/<user-specific>/memory/README.md"
  }

All keys optional; missing keys fall back to empty list / safe default.
