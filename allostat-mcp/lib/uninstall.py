"""Allostat uninstaller — wrapper-only removal across Claude Code + Codex.

Removes the ACTIVE MACHINERY only: the Claude Code plugin + its marketplace entry
+ MCP registration, and the Codex config.toml block. It does NOT touch a single
byte of user DATA — memory trees, handoffs, .allostat state, appendices — nor the
ALLOSTAT_MCP_TOKEN env var (the user's credential; a harmless orphan once the MCP
registration is gone, and left so a reinstall needs no fresh code).

Removing the wrapper fully DISABLES Allostat (no hooks fire, MCP unregistered, no
banner); the user's files sit dormant and intact, and a reinstall resumes cleanly.

Design: all logic lives here (one testable module) so the PowerShell/shell entry
points stay trivial. The delicate text/JSON transforms are pure functions; the
`claude mcp remove` call is injectable so the whole flow is unit-testable without
a live CLI. Codex removal delegates to codex_wiring (shared markers with install).

Surface contract (Sol P2, 2026-07-18): the surface is ALWAYS explicit -- run()
requires it and the CLI requires --surface. Unknown ownership fails closed;
"both" is a deliberate, explicitly-requested full removal, never a fallback.
