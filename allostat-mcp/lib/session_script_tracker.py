"""Files this session wrote that could later be EXECUTED (ISSUE-005).

innate-02 reads the command it is given, so `bash /tmp/cl.sh` tells it nothing
about the `rm -rf` inside the script. Measured on the bench VM, minutes apart in
one session: the script ran unguarded; the identical `rm -rf` typed inline was
blocked.

This module is the small amount of memory that closes the gap for the one class
that is actually closable — a script the SAME session wrote. PostToolUse records
what was written; PreToolUse asks whether the command is about to run one of
them.

Deliberately not attempted: indirection in general. `curl | sh`, base64, a
Makefile target, `eval`, a script that existed before the session. String
matching at PreToolUse cannot see through those, and the limitation is written
into the guard's own message rather than left for someone to discover.

Per-session file so concurrent sessions in one project cannot see each other's
writes — a script session A wrote is not session B's business, and sharing the
set would make the guard fire on unrelated work.
