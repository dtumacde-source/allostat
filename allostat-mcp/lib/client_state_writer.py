"""Client state writer — v0.2.0 Option Z protocol.

The hosted MCP server returns `client_state_writes` instructions inside
`DispatchResponse`. This module:
  1. Validates each write against a whitelist of target filenames
  2. Validates the mode is compatible with the target shape (.jsonl=append,
     .json=overwrite/merge)
  3. Applies the write to `<state_dir>/<target>` on the operator's local
     filesystem
  4. Maintains an audit log of every accepted/rejected write at
     `<state_dir>/server_instructed_writes.jsonl` so the operator can
     forensically inspect what the server told the wrapper to persist

Privacy posture: server NEVER stores the content. The instruction is
composed in RAM on the server, transmitted to the wrapper, applied here,
and the server's copy is released. Only the operator's local filesystem
holds the persistent state. The audit log here is local-only too.

Whitelist (mirrors the server's ClientStateWrite Pydantic Literal):
  nudge_history.jsonl          append-only audit of fired nudges
  pending_proposals.jsonl      pattern-observer proposals between sessions
  pillar_history.jsonl         per-pillar decision history
  silo_entry.jsonl             routes to silos/<class>.jsonl by content.silo_class
  epigenetic_signature.json    learned operator preferences
  prediction_calibration.json  pillar accuracy tracking
  chronic_stress_baseline.json rolling baseline for cascade detection
  drift_seen.json              stress drift-seen dedup state

The wrapper rejects writes outside the whitelist, with invalid modes, or
that fail JSON-serializability. Rejections are logged to the audit log
with a `rejection_reason` field; never silently dropped.
