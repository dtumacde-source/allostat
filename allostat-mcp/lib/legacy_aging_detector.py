"""Legacy-aging detector — PATCH-191 (Phase 3.3a).

Producer for the `legacy_aging` observation event that volume-control's
4th detector (`should_nudge_legacy_aging`) consumes. Pre-PATCH-191 this
producer didn't exist; volume-control's 4th branch was structurally
unable to fire because nothing wrote the events it reads.

Strategy: at session-start, rglob the project tree for `_LEGACY_*` files
older than 30 days. If the count is ≥1, append a `legacy_aging`
observation with `file_count` in details. The existing server-side
`compose_volume_control_nudge` reads `legacy_file_count` from
`_volume_control_details_from_obs` which sums these observations.

Scope choices for v1:
- Scan project root (operator's cwd) with rglob
- Skip well-known build/cache directories to avoid scanning into
  third-party trees (.git, node_modules, __pycache__, .venv, etc.)
- Cap depth at PROJECT_SCAN_MAX_DEPTH to bound walk cost on huge trees
- Cap file count emitted in observation at OBSERVATION_FILE_LIST_CAP to
  bound observations.jsonl size
- Age threshold matches server-side constant
  `LEGACY_AGE_THRESHOLD_DAYS = 30`
- Operator can override via `ALLOSTAT_LEGACY_AGING_SCAN` env var:
  "" / "1" → scan enabled (default); "0" → disabled
  Disabling is useful for very large monorepos where session-start
  shouldn't pay the rglob cost.
