"""Session AUDIT writer with fingerprint dedup + per-project routing.

A2 REDIRECT (2026-05-24): writes aggregate-signal audit files to the
per-project audit tree (`~/.claude/projects/<sanitized-cwd>/.allostat/
audit/<ts>_session_end.md`). PRE-A2 these files wrote to
`~/.claude/projects/<sanitized-cwd>/memory/handoffs/` and squatted the
canonical handoff path. The canonical path now belongs to Claude-authored
rolling handoffs per the A3 protocol; the wrapper's auto-rendered
aggregate signal lives at the audit path for behavioral observability.

Function names retain "handoff" in their public API for backward compat
with callers (Stop hook, signal-phrase forced-write path), but the
written content is the wrapper's auto-rendered session_debrief output
(files touched, operator messages, caught/shaped/quiet) — not a
continuity handoff.

Fingerprint dedup on `(session_id, n_observations_at_prior_handoff)` so
a fresh audit file lands only when meaningful new work has accumulated.

Called from the Stop hook ABOVE the `_is_repeat_stop` debounce gate so the
write fires on every Stop boundary; the dedup keys decide whether to write.

See dev_patch_log.md (PATCH-181 origin, PATCH-FIXNOW-A2 redirect) for
design rationale.

    2026-05-31). This mirrors `.allostat/` state, which already roots in the
