"""Voice-keeper local evaluator — PATCH-190 (Phase 3.2).

Wrapper-side port of `allostat-mcp/allostat_server/pillars/voice_keeper.py`.
The pillar logic (markers + evaluate + composer) runs LOCALLY in the
wrapper so the server never receives raw assistant prose. This preserves
the privacy invariant in `ExcerptPayload`'s docstring:

    NEVER include:
      - operator's literal prompt text [...]
      - LLM response content

Voice evaluation inherently needs assistant prose to scan; running it
wrapper-side keeps the schema clean. Mirrors PATCH-143 precedent (innate
rules ported wrapper-side for the same architectural reason — server
shouldn't see what it can evaluate client-side).

Server-side `voice_keeper_evaluate` MCP tool is preserved as a direct-
tool-call surface (Claude can voluntarily invoke it on text it explicitly
passes). The autonomic firing path — invoked from UserPromptSubmit hook
between operator turns — is the wrapper-local code path defined here.

Constants are duplicated by design between this module and
`allostat_server/pillars/voice_keeper.py`. If either side updates, update
BOTH. Test coverage on both sides asserts parity.

        function literally named `leverage_existing_structure` is code; it
        should not trip the `ai_slop` marker for "leverage."
      - Indented code blocks (4-space leading, common Markdown convention).
      - Blockquote regions (lines starting with `>`). These quote operator
        content — when the assistant faithfully reproduces operator's
        word choices, slop in the QUOTE belongs to the operator, not the
        assistant.
      - URLs (`https?://\\S+`). URL paths often contain marker words by
        coincidence (e.g., `/leverage/` in an SEO blog URL).
      - Explicit double-quoted strings within prose. Operator-quotes are
        most commonly rendered with literal ASCII `"..."`. We strip those
        so quoted operator language doesn't count against the assistant.

    Returns the stripped text. Output preserves enough surrounding
    structure that downstream em-dash and passive-voice counts still
    operate on representative prose. Behavior on adversarial inputs
    (nested fences, unclosed quotes) is best-effort: the regex is

    """Inscribe one silos/voice.jsonl entry per detected violation.

    2026-08-07 — these rows are DETECTIONS, and they now say so. Until this
    date every one of them was written with `success_marker="voice_corrected"`
    while nothing was surfaced to the operator and nothing was corrected; the
    bench VM's 17 unsurfaced violations produced 17 rows all claiming a
    correction had occurred. Anything reading the silo as a record of what the
    operator taught was reading fiction, and getting more confident about it
    over time. The path now calls `record_voice_detection`, and
    `voice_corrected` has exactly one gated way in
    (`silos.voice.record_voice_correction`, which requires evidence the
    correction was surfaced).

    PATCH-195 (2026-05-24) — wrapper-direct voice silo inscribe. Called
    from evaluate_and_record after observation append. Mirrors PATCH-194
    drift inscribe semantic: heuristic auto-inscribe of the detected
    case so future recall fingerprint-matches against accumulated
    history. `canonical_sample` placeholder = the violation's sample_text
    (post-H-02 this is the marker phrase — evaluate_voice violations no
    longer carry raw response snippets, and the snippet-over-marker
    precedence below only applies to caller-supplied legacy shapes);
    `canonical_source` records that the inscribe was automatic
    rather than operator-vetted (future /allostat-voice-canonical
    command can promote auto-inscribed entries to operator-canonical).

        state_dir: operator's `.allostat/` dir (for resolving silo path)

    error doesn't break the voice-keeper firing path.
