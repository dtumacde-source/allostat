"""Voice silo — recurring voice-drift patterns + canonical voice samples.

Ported from the v2.3 plugin's lib/silos/voice.py into the v2.4 wrapper.
Second silo class (after drift). Follows the same shape as drift.py.

Signal class: a voice violation pattern keeps recurring (operator
strikes the same kind of phrasing repeatedly). Resolution: a canonical
sample of how the operator's voice should sound for this class.
On future generation, recall this silo before producing similar prose.

Token construction MUST mirror server-side
`recall_silos.compute_class_tokens` for class_name="voice" exactly:

    return [violation_type, sample_text[:60].lower()]

Drift between wrapper + server breaks recall — keep in lockstep.

# whole point (2026-08-07, benchmark finding).
#
# The voice keeper detected 17 violations in one bench session, surfaced NONE
# of them to the operator, and wrote all 17 to the silo marked
# `voice_corrected` — a success marker for a correction that never happened.
# Anything learning downstream was being trained on a false success signal,
# which gets more confidently wrong the longer it runs.
#
# So: DETECTION and CORRECTION are different facts and carry different
# markers. The auto-detection path can no longer produce the corrected marker
# at all — not by convention, but because it has no function that emits it
# (`record_voice_correction` demands evidence that the correction was actually
# surfaced and acknowledged in-session, and refuses without it).
