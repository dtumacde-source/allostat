"""MCP client for the Allostat hosted server.

Thin Streamable-HTTP client that hook scripts use to call server-side
pillar tools. Handles:

  - Bearer-token authentication (reads ALLOSTAT_MCP_TOKEN env var)
  - Endpoint resolution (ALLOSTAT_MCP_ENDPOINT, default mcp.allostat.ai)
  - Retry-with-backoff on 5xx + connection errors (max 3 retries)
  - Rate-limit awareness (honors 429 Retry-After header)
  - Request ID propagation (server-side request_log correlation)
  - Pillar-tool call helpers per pillar (one method per server tool)

Errors are surfaced as MCPClientError with .status_code, .body, .retry_after
fields. Hook scripts catch + degrade silently — the regulator must never
break the operator's session because of a server-side failure. The wrapper
plugin's behavior on MCP failure is: log the error to local
observations.jsonl and proceed as if the server returned no_op.

Lives in a Claude Code plugin runtime — Python stdlib only (no httpx,
no requests, no MCP SDK on the wrapper side). urllib + json is enough
for Streamable HTTP at this thin layer.

    """Read ALLOSTAT_MCP_TOKEN from the plugin's .env file.

    v0.2.5 PATCH-122 v5: tries multiple candidate locations because
    Claude Code may load hook scripts from EITHER the marketplace tree
    OR the cache/<version> tree, and only the marketplace tree had .env
    in v0.2.4 (install.ps1 only wrote one location). v0.2.5 install.ps1
    writes .env to both trees, but this multi-location lookup is the
    safety net so any deployment layout works.

    Candidates:
      1. <plugin_dir>/.env   (sibling to this module's lib/, the v0.2.3
                              canonical location — works when hook
                              loaded from same tree as .env)
      2. ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/local/allostat-mcp/.env
                             (cross-tree fallback — works when hook
                              loaded from cache tree but .env lives
                              in marketplace tree)

    NEWEST WINS, not first-hit-wins (2026-07-27). First-hit-wins made
    candidate 1 authoritative, and candidate 1 is VERSION-PINNED: it lives in
    cache/local/allostat-mcp/<version>/, a directory that is written once at
    install and then frozen forever. Candidate 2 is the one location every
    installer run rewrites. So once the bearer rotated, any session pinned to
    an older version directory kept reading a credential that no longer
    existed, while the live one sat in candidate 2 and was never consulted.

    The cost was total and silent. A rejected bearer 401s every MCP call, so
    SessionStart's `refresh_subscription_state` cannot reach the server and
    writes the fail-closed `"unknown"` sentinel; `should_inject` reads that and
    every downstream hook early-returns. Allostat stops writing handoffs and
    stops regulating while still appearing installed — the local innate rules
    keep firing, so the plugin looks alive. Measured on the operator's machine
    2026-07-26: bearer rotated 16:20:12Z, first 401 16:21:36Z, 598 following.

    Ordering by mtime is what distinguishes the two: the frozen copy keeps its
    old timestamp and the rewritten copy is always newer. Ties keep the
    original precedence, so a single-tree layout behaves exactly as before.
    This does NOT relax entitlement — it only stops a PAYING subscriber from
    being misread as unauthenticated. A genuine lapse still returns
    lapsed/canceled from the server and still disables the wrapper.

    Returns the bearer string or None if no candidate yields one.
    Best-effort: any error returns None so caller falls back to OS env var.
