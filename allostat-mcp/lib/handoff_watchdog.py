"""Handoff watchdog — wrapper-side enforcement layer for the A3 protocol.

A3 (2026-05-24) Fix Now memory-architecture refactor: Claude authors
rolling handoffs to `~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/memory/handoffs/<session_id>.md`
per the protocol shipped in `data/appendix_seed/claude_handoff_protocol.md`.
The watchdog ensures Claude doesn't silently drift off-protocol.

How it works:

1. Stop hook fires `check_and_set_reminder_state()` on every fire (debounced
   upstream by _is_repeat_stop for the heavy dispatch; the watchdog check
   runs cheap every Stop boundary).
2. UserPromptSubmit hook fires `consume_reminder_if_due()` on every prompt
   and injects escalation-level-appropriate text into additionalContext
   when a reminder is queued.

Anti-pattern detection (R5): a handoff file existing isn't enough — if
content is <500 bytes OR all sections empty, treat as a no-write. Prevents
Claude from satisfying the watchdog by writing an empty skeleton just to
update mtime.

Escalation (R4): the cascade-prevention requirement. Reminder level
escalates 0 → 1 (soft) → 2 (strong) → 3 (stub injection). Resets when
Claude writes a non-junk handoff. Without escalation, watchdog would fire
identical reminder every Stop and operator would disable it via env var,
collapsing A3 back to "Claude reliably follows protocol" — exactly what
we were trying NOT to depend on.

Env vars:
- `ALLOSTAT_HANDOFF_WATCHDOG=0` — disabled entirely
- `ALLOSTAT_HANDOFF_WATCHDOG_TURNS=5` — turn-count threshold
- `ALLOSTAT_HANDOFF_WATCHDOG_TOKENS=50000` — token-count threshold

Privacy invariant: watchdog is wrapper-side only. No new server payload,
no new observation content. State file is local-disk only.

State file: `<state_dir>/state/handoff_watchdog.json`.

    The Stop hook is the ONLY place `check_and_set_reminder_state` runs, so a
    hard restart where Stop never fired leaves an overdue handoff unqueued — the
    turns/tokens counters climbed (via UserPromptSubmit's `consume_reminder_if_due`)
    but no reminder was ever armed. `session_id` is stable across a Claude Code
    restart, so the per-session state file is still on disk. Re-running the
    watchdog check at SessionStart with the SAME session_id re-arms an overdue
    reminder so the next UserPromptSubmit surfaces it.

    Records the session identity baseline (prunes stale per-session files,
    adopts cumulative_tokens), then delegates to `check_and_set_reminder_state`
    so the elapsed/turns/tokens trigger logic is shared (no duplicated thresholds).
    Idempotent — re-call on every SessionStart; cheap on a fresh session (no
    accumulated counters → no trip). Best-effort: never raises.

    Returns the `check_and_set_reminder_state` result dict (or a skip marker).
