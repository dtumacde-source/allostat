"""Folder-drift detector — rule innate-12 (companion to canonical_workspace).

Folder drift = a strategic deliverable (project source-of-truth content)
being written to a generic drift folder (Downloads / Desktop / Documents)
when the active project has a canonical workspace declared. The rule YAML
lists this module FIRST under rule 12's `implementation.lib_module`:

    lib/folder_drift_check.py + new lib/canonical_workspace.py (TBD)

`canonical_workspace.py` owns the primitives (Downloads/drift detection,
canonical-workspace discovery, strategic-deliverable classification,
allowlist). This module composes them into the drift decision the Volume
Control producer emits as an observation.

Two surfaces:

  - check_folder_drift(target, project_root=None, content=None) -> DriftResult
      pure predicate. is_drift True iff the target is a strategic deliverable
      landing in a drift folder while a canonical workspace is declared
      (and the target is not allowlisted).

  - detect_and_emit(state_dir, tool_name, file_path, project_root, content)
      classifies + appends a `folder_drift_detected` observation. Mirrors
      rollout_detector.detect_and_emit: env-gated, tool-name-guarded,
      best-effort (any append failure is swallowed so the PreToolUse hook
      never breaks the operator's session).

Generic paths only — no operator-specific paths.
