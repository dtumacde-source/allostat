"""Client-side pattern-observer proposal generation — data-min Option A.

Runs the pattern-learning detection LOCALLY on the operator's own observations and
emits the exact `pending_proposals.jsonl` records the server's pattern_observer
pillar emits — so the learned-rule loop keeps working without shipping operator
language over the wire. Mirrors the wire-privacy pattern of `drift_recurrence_local`
and `voice_keeper_local`.

Migration-safe: records are deduped downstream by `hash` (proposal_review), and the
client hash is byte-identical to the server's (`pattern_fingerprint_local` is
LOCKSTEP), so this runs in PARALLEL with the server path without surfacing duplicate
proposals. Once the wire tail is stripped of operator language (later slice), the
server path fingerprints nothing and only this local path remains.

Record shapes are LOCKSTEP with server pattern_observer._detect_proposals_response
(kind="n5_proposal") and _detect_in_session_overrides_response
(kind="in_session_override").
