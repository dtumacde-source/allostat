"""Migration: relocate canonical_value from silo entries to canonical_resolutions.

Phase 2 (2026-05-28). On first SessionStart after the wrapper carrying this
module ships, walk every existing `<state_dir>/silos/<class>.jsonl` file.
For each entry that carries `resolution.canonical_value` and/or
`fingerprint.raw_excerpt` (pre-Phase-2 shape), extract the canonical text,
write it to `canonical_resolutions.jsonl`, and rewrite the silo entry in
its post-Phase-2 shape (hash + provenance only).

Idempotent. If an entry is already in post-Phase-2 shape (no canonical_value,
no raw_excerpt), it stays untouched. The migration runs every SessionStart
but does nothing on second + subsequent runs.

Marker file: `<state_dir>/silos/.phase2_migrated` written after the first
successful pass so subsequent runs short-circuit without re-walking. The
marker contains the migration's run timestamp + counts for observability.

Failure semantics: any per-file error (OSError, JSON parse error) is caught,
logged via the returned report, and the rest of the migration continues.
The migration NEVER deletes or corrupts operator data — it only adds the
canonical_resolutions entries and rewrites in place via atomic tmp+replace.

Not run on silos that don't exist. If an operator has no silos directory
(the common case pre-PATCH-194 inscribe activity), migration is a no-op.
