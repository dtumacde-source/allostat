"""E8 — version-skew banner (F4-class mitigation).

Problem (F4): the operator upgrades the plugin on disk (install.ps1 -Upgrade),
but the running Claude Code process keeps serving the pre-upgrade plugin
surface (slash-command defs and other manifest state are loaded once per
process). A *partial* restart doesn't reload them. The upgrade "silently
doesn't take" until the user FULLY quits and reopens Claude Code. Today that
stale state is invisible — the F4 diagnosis confirmed the on-disk delivery
was correct; the gap is purely a not-fully-restarted process.

This module detects that skew at SessionStart and surfaces a one-line nudge
("fully quit and reopen Claude Code"). It converts an invisible stale-state
into an explicit, self-correcting prompt. Wrapper-only — no server call.

Detection is false-positive-safe: it only reports skew on a *continuation*
of an existing process (a fresh process by definition just loaded the current
version, so there is nothing to nudge). Two independent signals are OR'd so
the check is robust whether or not Claude Code re-resolves the hook path on
upgrade:

  1. tree-skew — the hook is running from an older versioned plugin tree than
     the one currently registered in installed_plugins.json. This fires when
     Claude Code pins the plugin/hook path at process start (the common case;
     it is also why slash commands go stale). Zero false positives.
  2. stamp-skew — the authoritative registered version has moved away from the
     version this process stamped at its first SessionStart. This fires when
     Claude Code re-resolves the hook path to the new tree but still serves a
     stale in-process command surface. Keyed on parent PID + the SessionStart
     `source` field so a genuine fresh launch refreshes the stamp.

Best-effort throughout: any read/parse failure returns "no skew" rather than
raising. Opt out entirely with ALLOSTAT_UPDATE_NOTICE=0.
