"""Allostat sandbox-permission enforcement — PATCH-137 / v0.5.0 Slice 10,
refactored in PATCH-142 v1.2.0 to load patterns from per-user config.

Resolves the session's role from cwd-mapping and denies non-advisor
writes to sandbox-scoped trees (advisor project memory tree, advisor
sandbox folders).

Per advisor brief 2026-05-20 Concern 1: hook-automatic detection via
cwd-mapping (no operator env-var chore); ambiguity default = block only
writes to sandbox-scoped paths (option b). Behavior preserved across
PATCH-142 refactor; only the source of the path patterns changed.

PATCH-142 v1.2.0 — operator-leak fix (audit T1 + T2)
-----------------------------------------------------
Before: `SANDBOX_SCOPED_SUBSTRINGS`, `ADVISOR_CWD_PATTERNS`, and
`DEV_CWD_PATTERNS` were tuple constants hardcoded into this module
with operator-specific values (operator username, drive letter, dev
directory, side-project sandbox folder names). Shipped to every
paying customer's installed plugin — privacy leak AND functional
no-op on non-operator machines.

After: patterns load from `~/.allostat/sandbox_config.json` via
`lib/sandbox_config.py`. Code ships with EMPTY pattern lists; each
user authors their own config. Customers who never author one get
explicit no-op (matches v1.1.1 customer behavior, just by design
not by accident).

Audit ref: v1.1.1 audit T1 + T2 findings (operator-local audit doc; not shipped).

H-03 (Wave-2 2026-07-11) — frontmatter trust inversion
------------------------------------------------------
PATCH-146's CLAUDE.md frontmatter layers (2/3) originally outranked the
operator-owned cwd mapping (layer 4), so ANY cloned repo could
self-declare `allostat_session_role: advisor` and gain sandbox write
access. Frontmatter may now only DOWNGRADE privileges; the widening role
(advisor) is honored solely from operator-owned sources (env var, cwd
mapping). See resolve_session_role for the full contract.
