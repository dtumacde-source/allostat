"""Learned-rule writer — write-side of the pattern-observer learning loop.

The pattern-observer detects a recurring operator behavior, proposes a
rule, the operator approves it via /allostat-promote, and THIS module
persists the approved proposal as a learned-rule YAML under
`<state_dir>/rules/learned/`. Before this module shipped there were zero
references to `rules/learned/` anywhere — the loop could detect + propose
but never persist, so the Pro-tier "it learns" feature never actually
remembered anything.

Loader contract
---------------
The persisted YAML must be consumable by the SAME loader that reads
`rules/innate/*.yaml` (`innate_rules._load_rules`): a top-level dict that
`yaml.safe_load` parses, carrying at minimum `id` (the loader derives one
from the filename stem if absent, but we set it explicitly). We mirror the
innate-rule field shape — `id / name / tier / severity / status /
description` — and add a `behavior` directive (the operator-approved
default) plus a `provenance` block linking the rule back to the proposal
that produced it (proposal hash, fingerprint, occurrence count).

Idempotency
-----------
Filename is derived deterministically from the proposal hash, and the YAML
body is hand-emitted in a fixed field order, so re-persisting the same
proposal yields the same path AND byte-identical content (no duplicate
files, no churn). This matters because /allostat-promote may be re-run.

Public API
----------
  write_learned_rule(state_dir, proposal) -> Path
      Persist one approved inner-proposal dict; returns the written path.

The `proposal` argument is the inner proposal dict the server emits —
identically what `proposal_review.PendingProposal.to_proposal_dict()`
returns. Filesystem-only; no network.
