"""Proposal B — live-time line for per-turn injection.

The UserPromptSubmit hook injects a fresh `now:` line every turn so the agent
always has a current clock. Without it, the agent anchors on the SessionStart
date (which never refreshes) and confabulates time-of-day on multi-day sessions
— the operator-reported "starts telling me to go to bed" drift.

`format_now_line` is a pure function (datetime in → line out) so it is fully
deterministic under test. The hook supplies `datetime.now().astimezone()` (an
aware local datetime) so the operator's local wall-clock offset is visible and
the agent can reason about local time-of-day.
