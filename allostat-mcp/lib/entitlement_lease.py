"""Verify a signed entitlement lease. Stdlib only, verification only.

## What this defends against, stated accurately (advisor ruling, 2026-07-20)

**Casual tampering and lease sharing. Not a determined local user.**

Before this, entitlement lived in an unsigned JSON file, so the bypass was
"change one word to `active`". That instruction fits in a forum comment and
propagates; it ends a pricing model. A signed lease removes the one-line bypass
and makes a lease non-shareable between accounts.

It does **not** stop someone with write access to the plugin. Explicitly out of
scope, by name:

  * patching this file or bypassing the caller;
  * replacing the vendored public key with one they control;
  * **rolling the system clock back, or freezing it, to keep a lease inside its
    signed window.**

None of these needs the issuer's private key. That is accepted. The population
willing to patch source at $25/mo is small, and more importantly their method
does not spread the way a JSON edit does.

**On the clock specifically, because silence there reads as a claim.** The
signature bounds the *signed interval* to three days. It cannot bound *real
elapsed time* — that would need trusted time, a monotonic source, or persisted
rollback state, none of which exist here. A local user who holds their clock
inside the signed window keeps the lease longer than three real days. They are
already outside this threat model; patching the verifier would be easier. So
**"three days" is a bound on the interval a lease may assert, never a guarantee
about real time elapsed on a machine we do not control.**

**Do not describe this as stopping determined users.** Real enforcement would
require server-authorized value, which conflicts with the client-side privacy
positioning — a product decision, not a crypto one.

## Why RSA and not Ed25519 (advisor ratified 2026-07-20)

The wrapper is stdlib-only: `pyproject.toml` declares `dependencies = []` and
the public README says "stdlib only — no httpx, no MCP SDK on the wrapper side".
The plugin must install on whatever Python a customer already has, so a compiled
wheel like `cryptography` would turn an unusual platform into an install failure
at the moment someone is trying to pay. Hand-rolling Ed25519 means ~150 lines of
curve arithmetic; RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 verification is `pow(sig, 65537, n)` plus a
byte comparison, with Python's own bignum doing the work. Codex independently
confirmed interoperability with `cryptography`'s PKCS1v15/SHA-256 signer.

## The three defects Codex found here, and what closes them

1. **`e=1` accepted a forged signature.** The first version validated modulus
   *length* and nothing else. With `e = 1`, `pow(s, 1, n) == s`, so the encoded
   block is its own valid signature and anyone can mint a lease with a key they
   invented. That is not a weak check, it is the absence of a signature check.
   Now: the exponent must be exactly 65537 and the key is validated before any
   lease processing.
2. **Identity binding was optional.** `expected_user_id`/`expected_namespace`
   defaulted to `None` and were checked only when supplied, so the default call
   accepted another customer's lease — and the happy-path tests demonstrated
   that shape. They are now required arguments. An optional security parameter
   is a fail-open with a nicer name.
3. **The operator-locked 3-day lifetime was not enforced.** `issued_at` was
   signed and never read; only `expires_at > now` was checked, so a ten-year
   lease verified. The lifetime is now a client-side invariant, which means an
   issuer bug cannot silently mint non-revocable entitlement.

**Verification only.** No private key material reaches a customer's machine, and
every failure path here resolves to "not entitled".
