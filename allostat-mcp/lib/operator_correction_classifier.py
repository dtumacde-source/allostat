"""Operator-correction classifier — PATCH-189.

Classifies an operator prompt as correction vs non-correction (task /
authorization / brainstorming / Claude Code internal event). Used by
the UserPromptSubmit hook to decide whether to append an
`operator_correction` observation that pattern-observer can fingerprint.

Pre-PATCH-189 the classifier lived inline in the hook with a broad
``\\b(prefer|please|always)\\s+\\w+`` pattern that matched every task prompt
("please check X", "please make Y"). Phase 2 Investigation 1 empirical:
11 events tagged `operator_correction` in a 5-hour autonomous-run window,
only 1 was an actual correction. Pool was poisoned → pattern-observer
couldn't cluster real corrections at the N=5 threshold.

Post-PATCH-189: precision over recall. Each pattern is high-precision —
we'd rather miss some real corrections than admit task prompts. Plus a
blacklist filter for Claude Code internal events (task notifications,
system reminders).

Mirrors server-side `dispatch_tools._CORRECTION_PATTERNS` +
`_is_operator_correction`. If either side updates, update BOTH; the two
sides ship through different pipelines (wrapper bundle vs server
staging→prod) so no shared source. Test coverage on both sides asserts
equivalent behavior.

# assistant did. Corrections point backward; task setups point forward. This
# is deliberately narrow: it keys on how the prompt OPENS, so an ordinary
# correction that happens to contain "you are" mid-sentence is unaffected.
