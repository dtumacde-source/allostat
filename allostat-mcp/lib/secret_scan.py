"""Secret-shaped path detection — shared denylist + post-build inspection gate.

RB-4 (Codex audit P0-1 / P0-2): secret-shaped files (credentials, private
keys, .env files) could previously end up in the customer bundle
(wrapper/scripts/make_bundle.py) and in the staging deploy tarball
(server/scripts/deploy_staging.sh) with no dedicated safeguard beyond
whatever exclusion list each script happened to already carry.

This module is the single source of truth for "does this path look like a
secret?" so both build points share one implementation instead of two glob
lists that can silently drift apart.

Two layers, both backed by the same `is_secret_shaped()` predicate:
  1. PREVENTION — callers filter file lists before writing the artifact.
     make_bundle.py's `_excluded()` calls `is_secret_shaped()` directly.
     deploy_staging.sh's `tar --exclude` mirrors the same denylist items
     (tar has no Python hook to call this module during assembly), and
     is deliberately blunt/conservative there since it is a shell glob.
  2. DETECTION (fail-safe) — `scan_zip` / `scan_tar` / `scan_directory`
     inspect an ALREADY-BUILT artifact, and `assert_clean` raises (or the
     CLI exits non-zero) if anything secret-shaped is present — independent
     of whether prevention worked. This is the "post-build inspection
     gate" required by RB-4: it still catches a leak even if a future edit
     to an exclusion list reopens the hole.

Deliberately reasonable, not maximal, about what counts as secret-shaped.
A naive `"secret" in name` substring check would flag real shipped source
in THIS repo:
  - wrapper/lib/secret_redaction.py                  (source, ships)
  - wrapper/rules/innate/01-secrets-protection.yaml   (source rule, ships)
  - wrapper/rules/innate/01-secrets-protection.json   (build artifact
    vendored by make_bundle.py's innate-rule JSON step — REQUIRED at
    runtime by the wrapper's innate-rule loader; silently excluding it
    would disarm a safety rule for every customer)
None of those are secrets; they are code/config *about* secrets. The
token/secret/credential substring check therefore only fires for a narrow
set of extensions actually used for flat credential dumps (no extension,
.txt, .ini, .cfg, .conf) — never .py, .yaml/.yml, .json, .md, .js, .ts, etc.

Explicit `.example` / `.sample` / `.template` files (e.g.
server/deploy/deploy.env.example, server/.env.dev.example — both real,
already-committed onboarding templates in this repo) are never
secret-shaped, regardless of what else matches, since they are the
conventional way to document a secret's *shape* without holding a real
value.
