"""A3 (2026-06-26) — transcript→handoff floor-capture (detect-before-write).

The A3 watchdog (`handoff_watchdog.py`) only NAGS. If the agent never writes a
rolling handoff, nothing captures the session — continuity is lost. This module
is the floor: when a session reaches the failure boundary (escalation at the
ceiling OR ending overdue) with NO substantive handoff on disk, it writes a
minimal handoff distilled from the transcript so the next session has SOMETHING
to resume from.

Strict detect-before-write (this is the only module in the A3 stack that WRITES
operator-tree content):
  - Writes ONLY when ALL of: at-ceiling-or-ending-overdue; AND no substantive
    handoff already exists (reuse `handoff_watchdog._passes_anti_pattern_check`);
    AND a readable transcript exists.
  - NEVER overwrites a substantive handoff — the existence check is the guard,
    and a substantive file short-circuits before any write.
  - NEVER overwrites ANY non-empty agent-authored file, substantive or not
    (audit 2026-07-20). `_passes_anti_pattern_check` is a heuristic: a real,
    detailed handoff that puts everything under `## Focus` and honestly marks
    the other three sections `(none)` scores 1-of-4 and FAILS it. That is
    precisely the file sitting at the escalation ceiling where the floor fires,
    so the failing check used to guarantee the floor clobbered it. The floor now
    diverts to a sibling `<session_id>.autocaptured.md` whenever the canonical
    path already holds bytes this module did not write. Archive-never-destroy is
    absolute here, matching every sibling mutation in the memory subsystem
    (_backup_then_write, _archive_reconcile_loser, MEMORY.md.PRE_*).

Caveat #3 (advisor signoff 2026-06-26): the floor is continuity INSURANCE, not
"protocol satisfied". The file carries `autocaptured: true` + `source:
transcript-floor` frontmatter, and `handoff_watchdog._passes_anti_pattern_check`
treats any `autocaptured: true` file as NON-substantive. So the next session's
watchdog still expects — and nags for — a substantive human-authored
replacement. The floor never resets the watchdog.

Privacy invariant: wrapper-side only. The transcript is read locally; nothing
new crosses to the server.

    bytes this module did not author.

    Round-7 inversion (advisor 2026-07-23): round 6 exclusive-created the
    FINAL shared pathname directly and, on a failed write, closed the
    descriptor and unlinked that shared name — a non-cooperating writer that
    replaced the pathname in the close->unlink window had its bytes deleted
    by cleanup that never proved it still owned the name. Cleanup must only
    ever touch a name THIS call provably owns. So the mechanics move to
    temp+link:

      - ALL bytes are written and fsync'd to a UNIQUELY-OWNED temp name
        (O_EXCL; pid + timestamp + a process-lifetime sequence — no other
        writer can produce this exact name). Partial bytes never reach any
        shared pathname, on any path, including failure paths.
      - Publish is `os.link(temp, dest)` — an atomic no-clobber primitive the
        OS enforces against ALL writers, cooperating or not, with no
        check-then-create window. `FileExistsError` is the expected
        someone-else-won-the-name signal: discard the temp, version around
        (round-6's occupied-destination contract, unchanged).
      - The containing directory is fsync'd after a successful link on
        POSIX, so the publish survives a crash. Windows cannot fsync a
        directory handle; a no-op there.
      - Cleanup unlinks ONLY the temp — ours by construction at every point
        in time — never the destination or the versioned sibling.
      - Advisor correction 5: any OTHER OSError from os.link (EPERM/ENOSYS on
        network shares, FAT32, container mounts) means this filesystem
        cannot do atomic no-clobber at all. There is NO fallback write to a
        shared name — that would re-expose partial bytes at a shared
        pathname, the three-rounds bug by another route. Instead: fail
        CLOSED — keep the fsynced temp (content preserved, not lost), write
        nothing to the canonical or versioned name, surface the degradation
        loudly, return None.

    Destination selection (round-6 contract, unchanged): destination absent
    -> publish at the canonical name; destination occupied (ours, empty, or
    foreign) -> publish at a VERSIONED sibling
    `<stem>.floor-<utcstamp>-<pid><suffix>` instead. These versioned siblings
    are plain `<sid>*.md` files like any other handoff: `handoff_discoverer.py`
    picks them up by its ordinary newest-first glob, with no marker involved
    — the marker only distinguishes floor identity elsewhere
    (`handoff_watchdog.py`'s "is this an autocaptured floor?" check).

    """Write a floor handoff iff the strict detect-before-write conditions hold.

    Returns the path written, or None when nothing was written (the common case).

    Conditions (ALL must hold):
      1. session_id is present and the watchdog isn't disabled.
      2. The session is at the failure boundary: `ending_overdue` OR
         `at_ceiling` OR escalation_level >= the watchdog ceiling.
      3. A readable transcript with at least one text turn exists.
      4. No substantive handoff already exists at the canonical path
         (`_passes_anti_pattern_check` is False there) — so a real handoff is
         NEVER overwritten.

    Destination (round-6 redesign, reviewer 2026-07-23): the canonical
    `<session_id>.md` is the preferred slot when it is absent, empty, or an
    autocaptured floor this module wrote. Any other bytes there are
    operator/agent content — the floor then prefers the sibling
    `<session_id>.autocaptured.md` slot instead. Either way, landing itself is
    exclusive-create-only (`_land_floor_write`): if the preferred slot is
    already occupied by the time of the actual write — including our OWN prior
    floor, refreshed — the write lands at a VERSIONED sibling
    (`<stem>.floor-<utcstamp>-<pid><suffix>`) instead. Nothing is EVER
    overwritten, truncated, or deleted; a refresh of our own earlier floor now
    always produces a newer versioned file rather than an in-place update.
    Versioned siblings are plain `<sid>*.md` files picked up by
    `handoff_discoverer.py`'s ordinary newest-first glob by recency — no
    marker involved in that selection. `AUTOCAPTURED_MARKER` is what floor-
    file identity is decided by elsewhere (`handoff_watchdog.py`'s frontmatter
    check), not what discovery ranks on.

    Never raises — best-effort continuity insurance.
