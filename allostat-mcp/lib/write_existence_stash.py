"""Pre-write existence stash (pre-release item 12).

PostToolUse classifies successful Write tool calls as `file_created`
vs `file_written`, but it fires AFTER the Write completed — the target
always exists by then, so `file_created` was unreachable and the
server-side KISS / volume-control detectors that consume it were
starved. PreToolUse stashes whether the target existed BEFORE the
write; PostToolUse pops the stash to classify.

Storage: `<state_dir>/state/pre_write_existence.json` — a small dict
{file_path: existed_bool}. Entries are consumed on pop; the map is
capped so stale entries (PostToolUse never fired) can't accumulate.

Best-effort like the rest of local state: filesystem errors degrade to
"unknown" (None) and the caller falls back to `file_written`.
