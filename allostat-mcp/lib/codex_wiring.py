"""Codex install/uninstall — marker-fenced block writer for ~/.codex/config.toml.

The Codex adapter (1.4.56) routes hook events + the MCP server into Codex via a
block in `~/.codex/config.toml`. This module owns that block: it writes it on
install and removes it on uninstall, symmetrically, using a single pair of fence
markers so the two operations can never drift apart.

Design invariants (advisor 2026-07-06 installer asks):

  1. MARKER-FENCED, never a TOML reformat. We only ever add/remove the text
     BETWEEN the fences; every other line in config.toml is byte-preserved. A
     partial or hand-edited config is never corrupted — worst case the block is
     re-appended fresh. (install is idempotent: any existing fenced block is
     replaced, not duplicated.)
  2. ENV-ONLY TOKEN, structurally. render_block() accepts only the env-var NAME
     (token_env_var) — there is no parameter to pass a raw secret, so the
     installer physically cannot write a plaintext token into config.toml. Codex
     reads the bearer from the environment via `bearer_token_env_var`.
  3. WRAPPER-ONLY on uninstall. remove_block() strips exactly this managed block
     (the MCP registration + the four hooks). It touches nothing else — no user
     memory, no state, no other config. Removing the block fully disables the
     Codex integration; the user's files are never in scope here.

Emission (2026-08-05, H01 closure — the launcher grammar): every hook `command`
line is the CANONICAL INTERSECTION GRAMMAR —
`python -P -m allostat_mcp_codex_launcher <event> --harness codex` — every
token bare, drawn from [A-Za-z0-9_.-]; one form for every shell Codex may hand
the command to (cmd with or without DelayedExpansion, PowerShell, POSIX) AND
for the old whitespace-splitting runtime (<=0.145). No machine path, no
quoting, and NO version probe on the emit path; machine paths live in the
launcher module the installer generates into the user's site-packages
(`render_installed_launcher`), which the `-P` keeps a project directory from
shadowing. Do not hand-write that command anywhere: `canonical_hook_command()`
is the single source, and the shipped documentation is RENDERED from it
(`wrapper/tests/_launcher_doc_contract.py`).

The per-shell quoting/refusal machinery below (`_codex_command_token`,
`_windows_short_path`, the quote-aware recognition) is RETAINED for
recognizing and migrating LEGACY configs — it is never used to emit.
`codex_cli_version()` remains only for the update notice.

All functions are pure text transforms (no I/O) except read_config/write_config,
`render_installed_launcher` (reads the launcher source shipped beside this
module), and the codex version probe (`_default_version_probe`, update-notice
only). Output is verified to parse as TOML by the tests (tomllib).
