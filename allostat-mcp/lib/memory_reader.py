"""Allostat memory reader — PATCH-138 / v0.6.0 Slice 5.

Privacy lock (per advisor brief 2026-05-20 §1.2 + ship contract
pillar_post_processing_contract.md):
  - Memory CONTENT is read locally only
  - ZERO snippet ever crosses to server
  - Server returns abstract nudge metadata (template ID + interpolation

# B1 (2026-06-26) — core-view formatter. Hard cap so the injected memory index
# has a context backstop.
#
# Raised 8000 -> 12000 on 2026-08-07, deliberately. Until then `## Project` and
# `## Reference` collapsed to a bare count, so the cap only ever had to cover
# the behavioral layer. Now every section carries its entries (bounded by
# _SECTION_ENTRY_CAP below), and the cap has to cover them without truncating
# the sections it was just taught to include — truncation runs from the end,
# and Project/Reference sit at the end. The real bound on growth is the
# per-section cap, not this; this is the backstop.
_CORE_INDEX_MAX_CHARS = 12000

# Sections that cap their entry count in the core view. Behavioral rules
# (## Feedback, ## PURPOSE, ## THE LAW, anything not listed here) are always-on
# and stay complete — lazy-loading them reinstates the drift they prevent.
_CAPPED_SECTIONS = ("Project", "Reference", "Other")

# Entries per capped section in the core view.
#
# This replaces the collapse-to-a-count that shipped from 2026-06-26 to
# 2026-08-07 (ISSUE-006). Benchmarked on 199 questions against a tree Allostat
# had written itself: with the count, a fresh session answered 7 of 199 and
# volunteered that no such memory existed; the descriptions Allostat had
# already authored and stored — and then deleted on the way to the agent —
# were the missing cue. The saving was inverted too: the block spent ~150
# tokens on boilerplate to save ~40 tokens of payload.
#
# A count is not a cue. An agent reads on demand only when something suggests
# a demand, and "Project (1)" suggests nothing — which is why abstaining was
# the rational move. So entries ship, and the cap bounds the cost instead.
_SECTION_ENTRY_CAP = 20

# Share of the injected core reserved for the cue sections when the whole
# exceeds the cap. The behavioral layer is uncapped by design and on a
# long-lived tree it will fill the budget on its own; without a floor it
# squeezes Project/Reference back down to nothing, which is the defect this
# change exists to remove.
_CAPPED_SECTION_BUDGET_SHARE = 0.4

_HEADER_ALLOWANCE_CHARS = 900

# The ordered session-start procedure (P3, 2026-08-07).
#
# What the benchmark actually established: a one-line instruction to read the
# memory files outscored the product's own surfacing tenfold (F1 0.52 against
# 0.05). The imperative is the mechanism that works. The catalogue is not —
# handing over the index AND the instruction scored 0.40, WORSE than the
# instruction alone, because a list is read as exhaustive and the model stops
# exploring once it thinks it has seen everything.
#
# So this is a PROCEDURE, not an inventory: bounded, ordered, with a stopping
# condition, and it does not grow with the tree. Two things it deliberately is
# not:
#
#   - It is not "read all your memory files." That was measured: it buys
#     recall by spending calibration (it declined only 36 of 45 adversarial
#     questions against 43 for the gentler arms — it read widely, felt
#     well-informed, and stopped abstaining when it should have) and it cost
#     ~85k context tokens per query against ~26k. Step 4 scopes the read to
#     the leaf nearest the question instead.
#   - It is not a rule wall. It is fixed at these lines. If it starts
#     accumulating clauses, it has become the thing it replaced.
#
# Step 5 is the abstention clause, and it is load-bearing: it exists to claw
# back the calibration the read order costs. It ships only if measurement says
# it does.

    carrying their descriptions (capped, newest-first), plus an explicit on-disk
    pointer. Returns None when there is no MEMORY.md or it is empty. Never
    raises on a missing dir (resolve_memory_dir may point at a not-yet-
    scaffolded folder; read_project_memory returns an empty snapshot).

    The header is deliberately one line of teaching. It used to carry a
    paragraph explaining the tree, the collapse rule, and where leaves live —
    ~150 tokens of packaging in a block whose payload had been cut to ~40.
