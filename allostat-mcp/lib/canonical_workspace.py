"""Canonical-workspace path classifier — rule innate-12.

Rule 12 (canonical-workspace-write-nudge) hard-pauses when a *strategic
deliverable* is about to be written to the operator's Downloads folder
while the active project has a *canonical workspace* declared. Strategic
deliverables (Phase docs, market analyses, strategy memos, product
decisions) belong in the project's source-of-truth workspace, not in
Downloads where they go stale or get edited as a phantom canonical copy.

This module is the wrapper's filesystem-side computation. The server has
no visibility into the operator's machine, so all path logic lives here.
It mirrors the idiom of `filesystem_context.py` (rule 04's analog):
  - a frozen result dataclass,
  - narrow filesystem inspection,
  - all filesystem errors treated as "no concern" → silent safe default
    (never raise; a hook must not crash the operator's session),
  - GENERIC paths only — no operator-specific paths (the server-side
    privacy invariant + the rule's `scope: universal`-by-construction
    intent).

Public API (consumed by the rule-12 producer wired in the main session):

  - is_downloads_path(path)         -> bool   # any-drive Downloads segment
  - is_drift_location(path)         -> bool   # Downloads / Desktop / Documents
  - find_canonical_workspace(path)  -> str | None
  - classify_write_target(path, content=None) -> bool   # strategic?
  - surface_canonical_workspace_write(target, project_root=None,
        content=None) -> WorkspaceDecision

Rule YAML contract this implements:
  rules/innate/12-canonical-workspace-write-nudge.yaml
    - trigger: write_to_downloads + canonical_workspace_declared +
      file_classifies_as_strategic_deliverable
    - heuristic_for_strategic_deliverable.filename_patterns / content_signals
    - allowlist.patterns (zip / pdf / screenshots / handoff / session_NNN)
    - scope: per-project (only fires when a canonical workspace is declared)
