"""Local-state helpers for the operator's `.allostat/` directory.

The wrapper plugin reads from + writes to the operator's local memory
tree. The server NEVER sees these files. This module provides:

  - resolve_state_dir: find the project's .allostat/ root
  - read_recent_observations: tail of observations.jsonl (parsed)
  - append_observation: append one observation event
  - read_session_state: parse state.json
  - read_drift_seen: parse stress drift-seen dedup state
  - write_drift_seen_entry: increment fire_count / set last_seen
  - read_orphan_salience_state / write_orphan_salience_state: orphan-
    detector salience round-trip state (pre-release item 50)
  - read_silo_entries: parse a per-class silo JSONL file
  - resolve_project_root: walk up from cwd to find an allostat-aware
    project root (.allostat directory exists at root or anywhere up)

All operations are filesystem-only — no MCP, no network. Best-effort:
file errors return safe defaults (empty list, None) rather than raising.

# M-04 (2026-07-15) — JSONL append/rotation lock.
#
# Rotation reads the whole file then os.replace()s it with the computed tail.
# Without a lock, a concurrent append landing between the read and the replace
# is clobbered (the append goes onto the pre-rotation inode/content, then the
# replace overwrites it with a tail computed *before* the append). The record
# is silently LOST.
#
# Fix: both the append path AND the rotation path take a single exclusive lock,
# keyed on a stable SIDECAR file (`<name>.jsonl.lock`). The sidecar is chosen
# deliberately: rotation os.replace()s the *data* file, so a lock held on the
# data file's own descriptor would be on the soon-to-be-orphaned inode. The
# sidecar is never renamed, so its lock identity is stable across rotation.
#
# GUARANTEE: mutual exclusion between threads and between processes ON THE SAME
# HOST (POSIX fcntl.flock / Windows msvcrt.locking). This covers the wrapper's
# real deployment shape (multiple hook invocations against one project dir on
# one machine — Windows dev, Linux prod). It is NOT safe over a network
# filesystem (NFS/SMB) where advisory locks may not be honored — out of scope
# for local `.allostat/` state. BEST-EFFORT: if the lock cannot be opened or
# acquired, the critical section still runs (unlocked) rather than breaking the
# operator's session — degrading to the pre-fix behavior only in that rare case.

# fields (operator_language/prompt/subject/text). Codex proved a denylist is
# structurally blind to the NEXT carrier — it found operator prompt text still
# crossing via `phrase` (session_end_signal_detected) and `prompt_excerpt`

# NAMES can never keep up with new carriers.
#
# Inversion: on the wire, a STRING value survives only if its key is a known
# metadata key the server actually reads (below). Every OTHER string is scrubbed
# by default; non-string scalars (counts/bools) always pass; containers recurse.
# Operator language is always a string under some key, so a brand-new carrier is
# stripped the day it is added — "metadata-only history" holds by CONSTRUCTION.
#
# The allowlist is defined against what the SERVER pillars read from the tail
# (audited 2026-07-14, dispatch_tools.py + pillars/*): stripping a consumed key
# silently breaks a pillar, so this set must stay a superset of every server read.
# Pattern-learning that consumed operator prose (subject/operator_language/text)
# already runs client-side (pattern_observer_local), so those keys are absent

    when it has not grown.

    Audit 2026-07-21: this used to count only the non-blank lines of the HOT
    file, and `rotate_jsonl_if_oversize` truncates that file to its last 1000
    entries. So the number a monotonic work-cursor was reading DROPPED by tens
    of thousands the moment rotation fired, and because the session_id had not
    changed, `current <= prior` stayed true for the rest of the session: every
    remaining session-end handoff was silently skipped, with no escape short of
    the operator typing an end-session phrase. Verified end to end before the
    fix (2000 obs -> handoff written; rotate to 1000; +700 obs -> still
    skipped).

    Adding the archived count restores monotonicity at the source, which fixes
    every consumer rather than one caller's comparison. The ledger is
