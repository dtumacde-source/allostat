"""Compose excerpt.retrievals from operator-local silo files.

PATCH-194 (2026-05-23) — Phase 3.4b drift silo retrieval. Closes the
v2.5 silo inscribe→retrieve gap: PATCH-192 ported the per-class inscribe
primitives; PATCH-194 wires the wrapper to read inscribed entries from
`<state_dir>/silos/<class>.jsonl` and pass them as `excerpt.retrievals`
on each dispatch call so the server's `recall_silos` pillar can match
queries against them.

Privacy moat: silo files live on the operator's local filesystem; the
wrapper sends them as excerpt slices on each call. The server's
`recall_silos.query_entries` filters by fingerprint hash and returns only
matches — non-matching entries are RAM-only on the server per
Architecture C.

Future cascade: PATCH-194 ships drift first. PATCH-195/196/197/198
mechanically replicate the dispatcher emit + this reader for voice /
customization / workflow / confidence_recovery. This module already
handles all 5 silo classes when their files exist, so the cascade is
read-side ready.
