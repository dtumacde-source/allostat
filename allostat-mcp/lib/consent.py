"""S3 Leg 2 — read the machine-global Allostat consent / update preference.

The installer (`install.ps1`, `Save-AllostatConsent`) writes
`~/.allostat/consent.json` at install time:

    {"consented": true, "consented_at": "...", "consent_version": "1",
     "auto_update": true}

Two consumers, with deliberately different defaults-when-absent:

- **Update notifications (Leg 3a)** — low risk (just a banner line). Default ON
  when there is no consent file, so installs that predate consent capture still
  see update notices. Governed by the `auto_update` flag.
- **Auto-fetch of updates (Leg 3b, gated)** — high risk (downloads + stages a
  new bundle over the auth path). Requires a DISTINCT explicit opt-in
  (`auto_fetch`) that the current consent flow does NOT set, so it is OFF until
  Leg 3b ships with its own consent. The notify flag does not enable auto-fetch.

- **Privacy-disclosure migration (rem-consent, 2026-07-22; two-step contract,
  round 6 2026-07-23)** — the installer bumped the consent COPY 1 -> 2 on
  2026-07-20 (the retired copy wrongly implied nothing you write ever leaves
  the machine; the shipped wire actually sends a prompt excerpt + each tool
  call's command/file path, held in memory and never stored). The installer's
  headless carry-forward is correct — auto-update must not re-prompt — but
  that left a customer on v1 transmitting under the retired disclosure with no
  corrected notice. `consent_version` used to be write-only; the functions at
  the bottom of this module READ it so the wrapper can (a) surface the
  corrected notice non-blockingly at session start, (b) withhold the
  content-bearing fields from the wire until acknowledged, and (c) record
  PRESENTATION and ACCEPTANCE as two SEPARATE facts, never one write: a
  successful emit of the notice at session start records only that it was
  presented (`record_disclosure_presented` / `presentation_confirmed`);
  `consent_version` only advances in `acknowledge_disclosure`, called from
  user-prompt-submit on the customer's next prompt after a CONFIRMED
  presentation — the informed continued use the notice itself defines as
  acknowledgment. A customer can never be recorded as having accepted a
  notice nobody actually saw. See wrapper/hooks/session-start.py and the
  three dispatch hooks.

Best-effort: any read/parse failure returns the safe default, never raises.
