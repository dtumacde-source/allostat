"""Handoff discoverer — find Allostat session-end handoff docs.

Portability-hardened: no hardcoded operator-specific paths in the
resolution chain. Resolution order:

  1. `ALLOSTAT_HANDOFF_DIR` env var (operator override, takes precedence
     over auto-discovery — operators on non-standard layouts opt in here)
  2. Parent-dir walk from cwd for `<parent>/allostat_handoffs/` or
     `<parent>/.allostat/handoffs/` (catches the project-relative case
     when the session opens deeper than project root)
  3. `<project>/.allostat/handoffs/` + `<project>/allostat_handoffs/`
     (project-scoped, opt-in — only when discover_handoffs receives a
     project_root from the caller)
  4. Home-relative default folder under `~/Desktop/Allostat/...`
     (Windows) or `~/Allostat/...` (Mac/Linux) — covers the
     freshly-installed user with no env var set, finds handoffs in the
     default installer-created folder. Uses Path.home() so it's portable
     across operators.

Filename convention is `YYYYMMDD_<slug>_handoff.md` (slug optional).

    Injects ONLY the small resume core (last-session activity + what's open),
    never the full body, so it survives the harness's ~2KB session-start inline
    cap. The full handoff rides a pointer in the appended standing instruction,
    read on demand after the operator directs. Reads utf-8-sig so a Windows BOM
    is stripped.

    TWO bounds, and the second one was missing (Codex, 2026-07-20):
      * `max_chars` bounds the CORE, as a backstop against a bloated core block.
      * `block_max_bytes` bounds the **complete rendered block**, including the
        intro, the standing instruction, and the handoff reference.

    Only the core used to be bounded, while the appended path was unbounded — so
    whether the injected block fitted the cap depended on **how deep the
    customer installed the project**. Codex reproduced an exact-2,000 result
    with a long scratch directory and a pass with a short one. Deep paths are
    the norm on Windows, which made the headline continuity feature degrade
    based on directory layout.

    **Every return path satisfies the bound unconditionally.** The first attempt
    at this fix did not: when the fixed text plus the absolute path had already
    consumed the budget it returned them anyway (measured 3,258 bytes against a
    1,900 budget on a 2,603-byte path), and a one-byte-of-room path came back at
    1,901 because the elision marker was appended without checking that it fit.
    Returning an over-cap block does not preserve the pointer — the harness
    truncates the tail, and the tail is the pointer. The customer silently lost
    the reference to their own handoff, and deep paths are exactly where it
    happened.

    What yields, in order, is: the core first (it is recoverable through the
    pointer), then the elaboration in the standing instruction, then the
    *precision* of the reference — absolute path, then home-relative, then a
    trailing fragment, then the bare filename. The reference itself never
    disappears and is never emitted truncated.
