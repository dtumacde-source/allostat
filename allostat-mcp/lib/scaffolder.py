"""Allostat install scaffolder — PATCH-A / Tier 1.

First-run scaffolder that ensures Allostat's required structure exists on
customer install. Scaffolder handles:
- Bucket B empty templates (top-level `~/.claude/*.md`) — write if absent
- Tier 5 archipelago.json scaffold — write empty {} if absent
- Tier 4 per-project memory tree — first-cwd-seen detector + MEMORY.md
  + _PURPOSE.md templates
- Tier 3 sandbox folder scaffolding

**Bucket A static content** (memory_architecture, allostat_architecture,
artifact_taxonomy, canon_size_discipline) was injected always-on at
SessionStart pre-Bucket-A-dedup (2026-05-24). Now ships via the appendix
seeder (`appendix_system.py`) with topic frontmatter — loads ONLY when
prompt topics match. Closes the ~17KB-per-session bloat advisor flagged.

Honors load-bearing rules:

1. `feedback_ship_structure_not_content.md` — Bucket B templates ship as
   EMPTY section headers + brief descriptions. Customer fills own.

2. `feedback_migration_never_destroys_existing_files.md` — detects file
   existence BEFORE writing. Never overwrites customer edits.

3. `feedback_no_operator_paths_in_shipped_code.md` — no operator-specific
   content in any template or scaffolded file.

The scaffolder is idempotent via `~/.allostat/.first_run_complete` marker.

## How to use this file

Each section below holds feedback / project / reference files Claude has learned about your workflow. Lines stay under 150 chars (auto-enforced by Allostat).

Claude: THIS tree — not Claude Code's built-in `~/.claude` memory — is where this project's memory lives. To remember something for future
sessions, write a leaf file in this folder (`feedback_*.md` / `project_*.md` / `reference_*.md`) and add a one-line entry for it in the
matching section below. Allostat injects this index at every session start, so anything indexed here is found again next session.

## Feedback

(Feedback files document corrections you've given Claude. Add entries as Claude learns your preferences.)

## Project

(Project files document state of ongoing work. Add entries as new initiatives start.)

## Reference

(Reference files document external systems, URLs, credentials locations. Add entries as you discover external dependencies.)

# Purpose

This file holds the orienting framework for sessions in this project. Allostat reads it before THE LAW and before STATE.md so the model re-orients to your current purpose on every session start.

## How to use this file

When you give Claude a purpose for this project, write it here. Claude will read it on every session start and work toward it until you declare it fulfilled.

## Current purpose

TODO: describe the current purpose for this project.

## Failure modes from prior sessions

TODO: as sessions surface failure modes you don't want repeated, document them here so future sessions can avoid them.

    Registration is QUIET and AUTOMATIC — no interview, no questions — so
    the only protection against planting memory trees where they rot is
    this predicate. It refuses exactly the known-toxic root classes:

    - $HOME itself (a session opened from `~` is not a project),
    - filesystem/drive roots (`C:\\`, `/`),
    - temp trees (OS tempdir + TEMP/TMP/TMPDIR) — scratch dirs vanish,
    - anything under `~/.claude` — the harness namespace; scaffolding there
      recreates the 2026-08-03 orphan-tree class (a parallel memory tree
      the banner later reads as fact).

    Everything else is adoptable, including $HOME subdirectories and
    plain non-git folders: the product promise is that a real project dir
    just works with zero setup. Guards only what provably rots.

    This gates SCAFFOLDING (tree creation), never reading: an existing
    populated tree is always served wherever it lives. `.allostat/` state
    is also not gated — entitlement caching must work even in refused
    roots so regulation still functions there.

    `home`/`tempdirs` are injectable for tests. The env override
    `ALLOSTAT_ADOPTION_TEMPDIR_OVERRIDE` replaces the computed tempdir set
    so subprocess-level tests can exercise both verdicts from inside a
    pytest tmp_path (which IS a real tempdir); it can only ever widen
    adoption of temp scratch — never entitlement, never memory reads.
